 * the very same payload from a file, so an account switch that only touches
 * the credential store leaves the CLI signed in as somebody else. The payload
 * is passed in already built to guarantee both stay byte-identical.
 *
 * Every target is best-effort: a CLI install that cannot be written must not
 * fail the switch the IDE already accepted.
