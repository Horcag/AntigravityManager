 *
 * The provider surface this proxy speaks to (`v1internal` on `cloudcode-pa`)
 * has **no batch plane**: no batch resource, no deferred submission, no
 * server-side job. A live sweep found `POST /v1/batches`,
 * `GET /v1/messages/batches` and `POST /v1/messages/batches` answering the
 * framework's 404 and `:batchGenerateContent` answering a plain 501.
 *
 * So everything here is a **local deferred-job runner** over the same
 * `generateContent` calls the proxy already makes. It is a real implementation
 * of the client-facing contract — submit a set of requests, poll, collect
 * results line by line, survive a dropped connection and an app restart — and
 * it is worth having for clients that only speak batch.
 *
 * It is **not** the economics of a real batch API: there is no 50% discount,
 * no separate quota pool, and no separate rate limit. Every request costs
 * exactly what it would cost sent normally.
